# ProcessPause

> Because, honestly, I made this app **only because** I couldn’t find where to suspend a process in the Windows Task Manager… 🤷‍♂️

## What is this?

ProcessPause is a simple Windows app written in VB.NET that lets you **pause** and **resume** running processes. Got that program that’s trolling you and want to “freeze” it without closing? Here’s your solution!

---

## Features

- List all active processes (with ID, name, and status)
- Search processes by ID or name
- Pause (suspend) the selected process
- Resume (continue) a paused process
- Simple interface even your grandma could understand (no promises)

## Why did I make this?

Because seriously, I looked everywhere in Windows Task Manager and couldn’t find the “Suspend Process” option. So, I rolled up my sleeves and made ProcessPause. If you know where that button is, please let me know! 😂
